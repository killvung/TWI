# TWI
An application to experiment DORM stack. DORM stack stands for:

D - Deno 
O - Oak
R - React
M - MongoDB 

# Motivation
The future is near, with Deno released v1.0 recently, more and more people will start getting into Deno, so I don't see why didn't I get my hand dirty on it to build a quick application with it.

# Deno?
Deno is an JavaScript runtime environment authored by the creator of NodeJS Ryan Dahl, motivated by his [regrets with NodeJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA). From his vision, I can see how Deno runtime would be better than NodeJS for future development.

# What is this application for?
Secret

# How to run this (To be continued)?
Prerequisites:
-   Make sure you have Deno installed, you can run `brew install deno` if you have brew installed
-   After installed Deno, make sure you have [denon](https://deno.land/x/denon), the nodemon by for NodeJS, installed.
-   Make sure you have [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) installed

After clonning the repo, run `make start` to build the static files for frontend, then run denon within pm2 for the server.
